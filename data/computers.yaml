      The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 is a great choice if you only need a computer for office work.
      It's running Chrome OS, which means that although it can run many Play Store (the Android mobile
      store) apps, it cannot download most computer applications (think .exe or .dmg.)
      It also can fold into a tablet, so it is great for portability.
